      INTRODUCTION
      ============

    2: |+
      In this variant of the classic card game "Blackjack", you will compete against
      a computer AI that controls the dealer. The general aim of the game is to build
      your hand to be worth more points than the dealer's, while avoiding going bust.

    3: |+
      More specifically, to win the overall game, you need to win more rounds than
      the dealer by the time the fifty-two card deck has been fully cycled (a full
      cycle of the deck is when the deck has been depleted and reshuffled).

    4: |+
      At this point, if either player has a lead of at least two wins,they are crowned
      the Grand Winner.

    5: |+
      However, if neither player has amassed this lead, the game continues with the
      reshuffled deck and a showdown ensues; rounds are played until a lead of two
      wins is established by a player, who then becomes the Grand Winner.

      GAMEPLAY RULES
      ==============


    2: |+
      At the beginning of a round, the dealer and user are each dealt an initial hand
      of two cards.

    3: |+
      At this point you can choose whether you would like to "hit" and receive an
      additional card, or "stay" and receive no further cards.

    4: |
      You can also choose to "card count", which will give you access to a chart
      displaying an account of all the cards that have been revealed from play so far.
    
    5: |+
      You can use this chart to gain an idea of the way the deck weighting is skewed.
      Checkout "Strategy" for more on how to use this information.

    2: |+
      Twenty-one is all about deciding whether you're chances of winning a round
      are made better or worse by taking on the risk of drawing another card.

    3: |
      The potential benefit of drawing cards is that you can build your hand
      for a solid score and a better chance of outmatching the dealer.

    4: |
      However, if your hand becomes worth more than the 21 point limit, you go
      bust, and automatically lose the round.

    2: |+
      Twenty-One is a game whose flow inherently favours the dealer over other
      players. This is simply because the player's turn precedes the dealer's.

    3: |+
      As a result, the dealer doesn't have to walk through the minefield of
      adding random cards to their hand until after players have already
      traversed that terrain.

    4: |+
      If the player goes bust, the dealer wins the round before any question of
      risk for them is raised.

    2: |+
      Luckily, there are a number of drawbacks to the dealer's position that
      the player can leverage in their decision making to attempt to gain an
      edge.

    3: |
      For one thing, the player is able to view one of the dealer's two cards during
      their turn which can give them an idea of whether the dealer is set up
      for a strong hand or not.

    4: |+
      This can help the player gauge whether higher risk play is necessary to
      eke out a win for the current round, or whether a lower scoring hand
      should be sufficient.

    5: |
      Another significant drawback for the dealer is their inability to make
      independent decisions.

    6: |+
      In Twenty-One the dealer always adheres to a strict rule; they must hit
      for cards until their hand is worth at least 17 points, and then they
      must stay with their current cards.

    7: |+
      Because the dealer can't make decisions for themselves, they are unable
      to capitalize on a crucial element of the game; the deck weighting.

    2: |+
      As rounds pass and the deck depletes, more and more cards are revealed to
      the player.

    3: |+
      The cards that have been revealed share an inverse relationship with the
      cards that remain in the deck.

    4: |+
      Using this knowledge, (made accessible through the card counting table)
      the player is able to ascertain the likelihood that one or another type
      of card will be drawn next from the top of the deck.

    5: |+
      This they can then take into consideration when deciding their next move.
